## Installation
No installation required. Users can navigate to https://birdtracker.herokuapp.com/ to access the application on a computer or mobile device. 

## Usage
A contributer can add a bird by accessing a modal that appears when "Add a bird" is selcted. Information to add a bird (bird type, location, what the bird was doing & the time of day), along with a photo accessed using the Flickr API, is used to create a bird object in a database.

That new bird is added to the list of all birds. 
A user does not have to contribute a bird to look at the all birds page.

## Improvements
The first improvement to be made is one of basic functionality: to ensure the "add a bird" modal closes after the contributor hits submit, and that a submission message appears.

Next, the app would be improved by adding several functions. Allowing users to sort the birds by location or bird type would be the next step. Allowing contributors to select the image that accompanies their bird from several pulled from the Flickr API would further enhance the user experience. Implementing user authentication would open up useful options such as giving users the ability to edit & delete their contributions, and to select a list of favorites or goal birds.

Beyond that, the application would be enhanced with information from other bird APIs, such as giving bird information like region, habitat, habits, endangered status & whether they are migratory. We would also like to offer users the opportunity to listen to the birds' sounds from the app. 

## License
